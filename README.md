Code for Math major's thesis: Computing tools for Edge Detection in images

The objective of this thesis is to study some of the different methods available for edge detection, a fundamental discipline in the field of image processing and particularly useful in image segmentation.

Three types of edge detectors are presented: classical, based on differential operators; morphological, built on morphological mathematics theory; and fuzzy, as an extension of the latter, based on fuzzy morphological matehmatics.

In this analysis, the robustness of each method is studied. Namely, its performance on noisy images is compared to that on the image without noise, in order to conclude which method is more tolerant to the disturbance.


The used image was taken from the Berkeley Segmentation Dataset:

The images obtained fuzzy morphological operators where produced using the IMorph Sofware:
